- All and only global variables must be capitalised.
- Functions identifiers should have this format: `foo()` or `fooBar()` or `fooBarFoo()`.

- Instead they should've this format: `foo` or `foo_bar`.
- Object identifiers are allowed to have format of function identifiers.
- Only class names and special object identifiers can have format: `Foo`.
- Please don't hardcode.
- Important functions can be found in `public/common/js/common.js`.
- Important styles can be found in `public/common/css/common.css`.
- Keep `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` files seperate for faster page loading.
- All `events` should have identifier `e` or `event`.
- All errors and exceptions should have identifier `error`.
- Avoid using single alphabet identifiers.
